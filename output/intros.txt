As a Intranet Application Support Analyst, I worked from Jan 2003 to Jul 2007. And my major duty is Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private label and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that parameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers that arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful implementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives such as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface and make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during peak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT teams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i infrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production environment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the system to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99% compliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and approval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within the scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run team was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing maintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow for a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management Leadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which I filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus on and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague. Implemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure of the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to 7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be completed within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10 - 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of knowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain business functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.

It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information.

This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events.
