28126340, [I got my bachelor   s   computer information systems in computer information systems from devry university   city   state   us                     devry university. As a Intranet Application Support Analyst, I worked from Jan 2003 to Jul 2007. And my major duty is Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private label and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that parameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers that arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful implementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives such as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface and make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during peak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT teams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i infrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production environment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the system to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99% compliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and approval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within the scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run team was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing maintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow for a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management Leadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which I filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus on and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague. Implemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure of the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to 7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be completed within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10 - 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of knowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain business functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.

Design the story board using HTML and CSS and design database for applications by analyzing the customer requirements.. Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding standards of the overall application.. Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS: Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio 2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1) LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.

I have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers, helping them to their seats, grabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face. I worked as a host/server for about a year, so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi.

Prep consisted of cutting chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, and all types of veggies. I have been doing sushi now for 3 years. That is, Monday-Saturday 10-10, give or take a few hours. I have had random days off here and there and some holidays, but for the most part 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. I have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person's face when they bite into the food and love it.

42641525, [I got my associate of applied science   manufacturing engineering in manufacturing engineering from highline community collage. As a Air Traffic Controller, I worked from 08/1983 to 12/2015. And my major duty is While working more than 32 years as an En Route Air Traffic Controller (ATCS) in the En Route environment, I maintained the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the NAS. I was an expert at various disciplines of air traffic control while maintaining at least the minimum separation standard's, and adhering to procedures and regulation as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration.I worked from 04/2013 to 01/2015. And my major duty is Was a National En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) Subject Mater Expert (SME) and visited 16 En-Route Air Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) and identified ERAM anomalies. In addition to documenting ERAM's undesirable process, also recommending adaptation changes that resulted in the desired behavior for the affected facility. When not documenting ERAM anomalies, or consulting on ERAM work-a-rounds, I conducted training of the controllers at the sectors working traffic, concerning ERAM functionality. During my collateral duties as an IOA team member and a National ERAM SME, I was able to maintain my currency every month, and conducted OJT.I worked from 09/2008 to 04/2013. And my major duty is Served as a National SME on the FAA's Independent Operational Assessment (IOA) team. As a team member I collected data and collaborated on the final report concerning the operational readiness for ERAM's National Deployment.. 28 years of experience working transition sectors from domestic Air Traffic Services to Oceanic Air Traffic services. This airspace required manual coordination on route, altitude and time estimates with Oakland Oceanic sectors; as well as establishing oceanic separation standers for the affected flight before entering an oceanic sector. This Radar-Non Radar environment required me to correlate flight plans with incoming and outgoing tracks, and either terminate or re-identify the flight in a Radar environment.. Worked Arrival and Departure traffic In and out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for 32 years. This required closely working with a level 5 Approach control, facilitating the separation of aircraft during the transition phase of a flight from the terminal to the En Route environment. This requires a strong working knowledge of geography for expediting flight on their flight plans, while working within flow control restriction, weather, and volume limitations. And before the wide acceptance of GPS navigation this required long range vectoring, which required consideration of weather and traffic situations. Sequenced traffic for Seattle Approach (S46) from high sectors (above FL230) and low sectors (below FL240) as well as converging routes, in sectors that were over the Cascade Mountains, which introduced weather, and train factors.. With 28 years of experience working aircraft in a transitional phase of flight (back and forth from terminal and En Route) I have extensive knowledge and experience with different types of route structures including the new Advanced R-NAV SID's and STAR's with their descend and climb via phases of transitioning to and from the En Route to Terminal environment. As well as more conventional types of En Route navigation like Jet routs, victor airway, "Q" routs, "K" fixes, as well as point-to point GPS/RNAV/ Latitude/longitude Navigation, and conventional SID's and STAR's.. I worked daily military training flights on IR and VR routes, airspace reservation both moving ALTRAV and special Use airspace (SUA). I have experience with Naval (P3, F18, E2, A6 and EA6 aircraft, Air force (F16, F15, F4, C17, C141, KC35, B2 and B52), Army (A10, UH60, and AH64), and Air National Guard (F4, F15 and F16) and their missions. The sectors I was certified on had Naval, Air force, and Army bases and a joint civilian/Air National Guard base. My experience involves clearing fighters into and recovering fighters from special use airspace, as well as air refueling missions and helicopters for the Army back and forth from base to training grounds..

Have 32 years experience providing approach control services at uncontrolled, and tower controlled airports. One of the tower-controlled airports was Paine Field in Everett, WA. Pain field (PAE) is a key airport in the Boeing Company manufacturing process, and worked closely with Boeing in their testing and certification process for new airplanes. Also Pain field is an airport that many new pilots would go and do multiple practice approaches for training. This environment meant the traffic pattern at Paine field had a large variety of aircraft, Large commercial aircraft, navy fighters and small single engine trainers, this required the  separation and sequence the traffic but apply wake turbulence procedures in many instances. While providing approach control services at PAE, we meet the requirements to use 3NM separation in most of the area. This required vigilantes as to how fare the aircraft was from the RADAR antenna, and adding to the complexity of this particular airspace, was the West side was over water, or low lying land; but the train rose very quickly to the East, required different techniques for lost com or vectoring to the final approach course..
