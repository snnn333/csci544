Boozman College of Public Health- Integration Capstone Project         	Little - City , State During my Preceptorship Project (needs assessment and literary review phase) I conducted focus groups regarding underutilization of health education services in the community served by the Delta Area Health Education Center in Phillips County Arkansas. The overarching goal was to utilize focus group data findings to help the Delta AHEC develop a plan of action for quality/effective health education services delivery.  The project developed into my Capstone Project in which I developed a Services Promotion Plan to help address, and evaluate the barriers in health education services provided by the Delta AHEC, and also help enhance community based participation by minority residents. Bachelor of Science : Community Health Education , May 2007 Dillard University Community Health Education During my Preceptorship, I interned with a Dietitian at the Louisiana State Department of Public Health.
While attending meetings and trainings focused on health promotion, I was able to help implement public health programs throughout the city.  This opportunity allowed me to get my first view of how different organizations collaborate to meet health goals of the state.]

They are different but together they are a good combination for a more rounded point of view. Course work included animation, digital as well as traditional black and white photography, web design, oil panting, sculpture, print media, art history, childhood psychology, ancient civilizations and modern culture.

In my time at Lakes, I have taught 9th grade, 11th grade and 12th grade English as well as AP Literature and AP Language. Due to some teacher turnover and the adapting needs of the English department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of students at various ages.
