Boozman College of Public Health			  		   Little Rock, AR          University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Health Behavior Health Education Coursework May 2011 Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health- Integration Capstone Project         	Little - City , State During my Preceptorship Project (needs assessment and literary review phase) I conducted focus groups regarding underutilization of health education services in the community served by the Delta Area Health Education Center in Phillips County Arkansas. The overarching goal was to utilize focus group data findings to help the Delta AHEC develop a plan of action for quality/effective health education services delivery.  The project developed into my Capstone Project in which I developed a Services Promotion Plan to help address, and evaluate the barriers in health education services provided by the Delta AHEC, and also help enhance community based participation by minority residents. Bachelor of Science : Community Health Education , May 2007 Dillard University Community Health Education During my Preceptorship, I interned with a Dietitian at the Louisiana State Department of Public Health.
While attending meetings and trainings focused on health promotion, I was able to help implement public health programs throughout the city.  This opportunity allowed me to get my first view of how different organizations collaborate to meet health goals of the state.

While one does it through studying actions and artifacts to better understand different cultures and time periods, the other deals with feelings and views shown through art. They are different but together they are a good combination for a more rounded point of view. Course work included animation, digital as well as traditional black and white photography, web design, oil panting, sculpture, print media, art history, childhood psychology, ancient civilizations and modern culture. Internship 2007 Gov Trends － City , State Maintained several politicians' personal websites, transferred data from previous websites to newly designed websites as well as updating live sites news feeds.

After watching my grandmother pass away because no one in our family was capable of providing CPR, I realized I needed to step up and joined our local Volunteer Fire Department. I completed EMT training at Miramar College, and then a 12-week National Fire Academy, where I was one of only 4 women to pass.  It was truly the most physically challenging endeavor I've ever completed, but certainly one I am incredibly proud of!  I served as a volunteer Firefighter/EMT on the San Diego Rural Fire Department for 4 years.

54100393,  [CLS], , 10/2013 to 06/2017 English Language Arts Teacher Company Name － City , State I have worked at Lakes High School in the Clover Park School District for the past five years. In my time at Lakes, I have taught 9th grade, 11th grade and 12th grade English as well as AP Literature and AP Language. Due to some teacher turnover and the adapting needs of the English department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of students at various ages. As a result, I believe one of my greatest strengths is my understanding of the skills necessary at each grade level for students to successfully exist high school career or college-ready. 06/2016 to 06/2017 Head Of English Department Company Name － City , State For the past two years I have served as the English Department Head. This position required planning and scheduling of monthly departmental meetings, allocation of department funds, participation in the District Literacy Committee and disseminating information from administration to English teachers, and vice versa. To better serve the English department, I initiated monthly meetings with our Principal, Mrs. Mauer-Smith, to plan department meetings. Additionally, teachers were invited monthly to contribute agenda items or areas of professional development interest to inform these meetings and make them as meaningful as possible. 07/2016 to 06/2017 ASB Advisor Company Name － City , State I was very excited to accept the position as the ASB Advisor at Lakes High School. In our Leadership Program, I highly prioritized student-leadership and facilitation. It was a regular practice that I met with our Senior ASB officers to discuss Leadership Development content and project management that they would facilitate in future classes. I saw my role as advisor to highlight student abilities, passions and ideas to build beautiful products while teacher students the value of understanding the process by which products come to be. All year, we emphasized the pillars of Knowledge, Courage and Compassion to serve our student body and develop personally as Knowledgeable, Courageous and Compassionate people.
